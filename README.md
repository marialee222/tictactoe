## Tic-tac-toe App

## Description 
The Tic-tac-toe App is a user-friendly platform for playing the classic game of Tic-tac-toe. It allows users to compete against each other or play against the computer. The app is built using JavaScript with the React library and CSS for styling.

Functionality:
 - Users can start a new game of Tic-tac-toe.
 - Players can take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on the board. 
 - The app automatically detects and displays the winner or a draw.
 - Users can restart the game at any time.

## How to Run
To run the Tic-tac-toe App on your machine, follow these steps: 

	1. First, clone the tic-tac-toe repository to your local machine using the following command:
	 - git clone https://github.com/marialee222/tictactoe.git

	2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the Tictactoe repository in your terminal.
 
	3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
	 - npm install 

	4. Start the development server by running:
	 - npm start

	5. Once the development server starts, open your web browser and navigate to:
   	 - http://localhost:3000
 
	6. Play Tic-tac-toe!
	
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future improvements for the Tic-tac-toe App include:
 - Highlighting the Winning Line -- When a player wins the game, the app can animate the winning line by changing its color, or adding a glowing effect to make it stand out.
 - Transitions Between Game States -- When transitioning between different game states, such as, starting a new game, displaying the winner, or showing the game board, smooth transitions can be added to create a seamless experience (fading, sliding, or scaling elements on the screen).
